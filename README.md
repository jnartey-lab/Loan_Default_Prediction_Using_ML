Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning Models
Here's a summary of the steps in this project.

1. Data Preprocessing:

o Begins by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics (e.g., pandas, sklearn).

o The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The dimensions of the data are inspected to ensure it loads correctly, with 5000 rows and 14 columns.

o I then drops irrelevant features like 'ID' and 'ZIP Code' to prevent overfitting and reduce dimensionality, ensuring the model focuses on more informative features.

2. Data Exploration:

o Basic data exploration is performed, inspecting the first few rows and checking the shape of the dataset.

o The goal of this step is to understand the type and distribution of data before moving to model building.

3. Model Building:

o A variety of machine learning models are utilized, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Classifiers.

o The dataset is split into training and test sets for model evaluation, and preprocessing like scaling is applied where necessary.

o Models are then trained using the training data, and their performance is evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. Evaluation and Improvement:

o Metrics like classification accuracy, confusion matrices, and F1 scores are computed to assess model performance.

o The models are compared based on their accuracy to determine which one performs best for the loan prediction task. This project follows a standard data science workflow, from preprocessing and exploration to building and evaluating machine learning models.
